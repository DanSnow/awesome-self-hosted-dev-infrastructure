## Current Work Focus
Updating memory bank documentation after completing schema definition and application to list files.

## Recent Changes
- Created missing core memory bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Defined Effect schema for list files in `src/schemas.ts`.
- Created script `scripts/generate-schema.ts` to generate JSON schema.
- Generated `schemas/list-schema.json` from Effect schema.
- Added `$schema` field to all YAML files in `lists/` directory.

## Next Steps
- Ensure memory bank documentation accurately reflects completed work.
- Address any further user requests.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The Effect schema will be defined in a TypeScript file.
- The JSON schema will be added using the `$schema` field in the YAML files.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Using Effect for schema definition.
- Using `$schema` for JSON schema reference in YAML.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Some core memory bank files were missing and needed initialization.
- Successfully defined Effect schema and generated/applied JSON schema to list files.
